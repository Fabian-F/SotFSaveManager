# SotFSaveManager

This is a Save-Manager for Sons of the Forest.<br>
I created this for private use, so its probably not the cleanest, fastest or even safest code, but it does its job pretty well.<br>
Feel free to use it, if you want to.

## Features:
Currently this software has 6 functions:
- Reviving NPCs (Kelvin / Virginia)
- Teleporting NPCs to the Player
- Regrow Stumps to Trees or Regrow every (!) Tree

I plan on implementing more features as I need them.

## Install

### Building it yourself

Just Clone or Download this repository and open it with Visual Studio.<br>
Then Choose "Release" as a build configuration and build the project.<br>
You will find the files in the generated "bin" folder.
